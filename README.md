Attempt at a full-scale attrition map, featuring a sorta maze-like design.

Required on both client and server side in order to work. Will crash unless impact marks are disabled in settings, and sometimes crashes on loading the map. If the map loading crash occurs, just keep trying again, it will load eventually.

To access the map, enter the private match menu and type this:
map mp_fieldbattle
